## Welcome to dressup
dressup is a web application that allows users to upload pictures of their clothes and create personalized outfit combinations. The application is built using React and utilizes the CSS-in-JS tool Emotion. Additionally, automatic unit testing is available for the 'LookPart' component, located in the 'LookPart' folder under 'components'.
