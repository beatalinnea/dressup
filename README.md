# dressup

## Welcome to dressup

A React frontend, a Node.js Express backend API, and an agile SCRUM-inspired working method: my project for the course 1DV613 - Mjukvaruutvecklingsprojekt at Linnaeus University.

dressup is a web application that allows users to upload pictures of their clothes and create personalized outfit combinations. The application is built using React and utilizes the CSS-in-JS tool Emotion and Express and Node.js for the backend API. This repository wiki provides sprint backlogs, test reports and all necessary documentation.

## Source Code

The source code for the backend and the frontend is provided in this repository, each directory contains a README.md to provide more information.

## Visit the application
Unfortunately the application is not deployed at the moment. But there is a demo video in the wiki!
